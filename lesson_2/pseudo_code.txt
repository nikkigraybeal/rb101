1. a method that returns the sum of 2 integers

given 2 integers.

   -save the first as number 1
   -save the second as number 2
   -add number 1 and number 2
   -save the result in result
   -return the value of result


START
# Given 2 integers called num1 and num2 #
SET result = num1 + num2
PRINT result
END

2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

Given a collection of strings
 
iterate through the collection one by one
   -new value = new value + current value
after iterating through the collection return the new value

START
# Given a collection of strings called array#
SET iterator = 0
SET new_value = ""
WHILE iterator < the length of array
  new_value = new value + value in array at space "iterator"
  iterator = iterator + 1
PRINT new_value
END


3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

Given a collection of integers

iterate through the collection one by one
  save the element to a new array if the index of the element is even
return the new array

START
# Given a collection of integers called numbers #
SET iterator = 0
SET new_array = []
WHILE iterator is < the length of numbers
   IF iterator == even
     new_array = new_array + value at space "iterator" in numbers
   ELSE go to next iteration
PRINT new_array
END
