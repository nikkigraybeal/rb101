# Write a method that returns a list of all substrings of a string. The returned list should be ordered by where in the string the substring begins. This means that all substrings that start at position 0 should come first, then all substrings that start at position 1, and so on. Since multiple substrings will occur at each position, the substrings at a given position should be returned in order from shortest to longest.

# You may (and should) use the leading_substrings method you wrote in the previous exercise:

def substrings(string)
  result = []
  counter = 0
  loop do 
    break if counter == string.size
    counter.upto(string.size - 1) do |index|
      result << string[counter..index]
    end
    counter += 1
  end
  p result
end

p substrings('abcde') == [
  'a', 'ab', 'abc', 'abcd', 'abcde',
  'b', 'bc', 'bcd', 'bcde',
  'c', 'cd', 'cde',
  'd', 'de',
  'e'
]
